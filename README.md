# Online Coding Web Application

Welcome to our online coding web application! This platform allows users to choose and work on different code blocks in real-time collaboration. Users can act as mentors or students, making the learning process interactive and engaging.

## Features

### Lobby Page

The Lobby page serves as the main entry point for users. It displays a list of code blocks that users can choose from. Clicking on a code block takes the user to the corresponding Code Block page.

### Code Block Page

The Code Block page is where users collaborate on coding tasks. It distinguishes between mentors and students, allowing the mentor to view the code block in read-only mode while students can make changes. Real-time updates are facilitated through Socket.io.
